Linux and macOS
===============
Building this Tk extension requires autoconf on these platforms.
The steps are:

1. Edit configure.ac to set the TkGL version number.  The line which must
be changed looks like:

AC_INIT([Tkgl],[1.2.3])

2. Run autoconf.

3. Run the configure script.  You must specify the locations of the Tcl
and Tk source directories using the options -with-tcl and -with-tk. The
directories specified with those options must contain the scripts
TclConfig.sh and TkConfig.sh respectively.  For example:

./configure --with-tcl=$HOME/TclTk/tcl8.6/unix -with-tk=$HOME/TclTk/tk8.6/unix

Alternatively, you may simply run the bash script ci/macOS build_mac_tkgl.sh
from the top level directory.  That script will download Tcl and Tk source
code and build everything in this directory.  The final result will be in
the dist directory.



Windows
=======

1. Edit configure.ac as for the linux and macOS systems.  The nmake build
system will extract the TkGL version number from that file.

2. Run nmake in an appropriate MSVC build environment, such as one of the
"command prompts" provided with VisualStudio.  For example:

> cd win
> nmake TCLDIR=C:\TclTkSrc\tcl8.6 TKDIR=C:\TclTkSrc\tk8.6 -f makefile.vc

The compiled Tk extension will be found in win/Release*

Hints
=====

The scripts in the ci directory and the workflow files in the directory
.github/workflows provide additional examples of how to build TkGL.
